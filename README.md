Insurance Claim Application
=====================

A minimal and light ReactJS POC.

### Usage

Install dependencies

```
npm install
```


Start the API with json-server

```
npm run api
```

Start webpack-dev-server

```
npm start
```

Application is at http://localhost:3000


### Remarks

Due to small scale of the application i decided not to use the Redux for store control.

As a API solution I used json-server, its very fast to set up and easy to use.
